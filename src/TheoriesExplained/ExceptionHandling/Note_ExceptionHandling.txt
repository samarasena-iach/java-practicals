Exception Handling in Java Tutorial

What is an Exception?
    An exception is a generally unwanted event that interrupts the normal flow of your program.
    Here's a quick example of a simple code that would cause an exception.

        int myInt = Integer.parseInt("pants);

    We're trying to parse an int from the string "pants"
    parseInt() usually works with values such as '1', '13', '6547' etc.

    Upon execution we get [NumberFormatException : For input string: "pants"]

    This is where the exception handling comes in. Instead of just blowing up and terminating the program,
    you can catch the exception that's thrown and have special code to handle that situation elegantly.

    In Java, we do that with 'try catch' code blocks.
