Java Main Method Explained - What Does All That Stuff Mean?
youtube.com/watch?v=P-_Nzi_mCRo

JRE calls or triggers the main method using "MainMethodExplanation.main(args);" and starts the application

All the other pieces of the method such as "public static void main ...", simplt the Method Signature
are designed to make that call work.

    public -
        Why is it public? It is public because this method (main) has to be callable by something outside
        of this class. If this method was something else, like "private" or "protected", the JRE wouldn't
        have the access to call it.

    static -
        A static method is a method that can be called on a class without needing an instance of that class
        to run it against. That's how the JRE is actually going to call your program.
        It's not going to create an object of MainMethodExplanation and then run a main method on it.
        It's just going to run the main method directly on the class.

    void -
